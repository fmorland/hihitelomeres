Hihi are of cultural significance to the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand, the Māori, and are considered a taonga (treasured) species whose whakapapa (genealogy) is intricately tied to that of Māori. For this reason, the telomere data and associated pedigree for hihi will be made available by request on the recommendation of Ngāti Manuhiri, the iwi (tribe) that affiliates as kaitiaki (guardians) for hihi. To obtain contact details for the iwi, please contact Dr Patricia Brekke (patricia.brekke@ioz.ac.uk). This process is necessary in order to maintain current permit stipulations and in agreement with NZ’s laws regarding the Nagoya and Waitangi treaty.
